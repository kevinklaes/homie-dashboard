# **Homie Dashboard**

A custom Home Assistant dashboard built for wall-mounted tablets. 

I created this dashboard with the design philosophy of a single page overview for accessing the most important functions and controls of my house easily. 

Homie connects directly to Home Assistant over a Long-Lived Access Token and a local WebSocket connection which results in automatic caching.

## Security

⚠️ The HA Long-Lived Access Token is stored in plain text inside the config.js file. Anyone who can read the file has full access to your Home Assistant instance.

> DON'T BE like the guy in Massachusetts that has a room named Jason's room - if you have been on Reddit long enough, you will get the joke :)

**Recommendations:**
- Serve the file only on your local network — never expose it to the internet without authentication
- Create a dedicated HA user account for the dashboard token rather than using your personal admin account so you can limit access and exposure
- Revoke and regenerate the token periodically (HA → Profile → Long-Lived Access Tokens)
- For remote access, use a VPN (e.g. WireGuard)
