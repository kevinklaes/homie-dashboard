# **Homie Dashboard**
![Home Assistant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Home%20Assistant-compatible-41BDF5?logo=home-assistant&logoColor=white)

A custom Home Assistant dashboard built for wall-mounted tablets. 

I created this dashboard with the design philosophy of a single page overview for accessing the most important functions and controls of my house easily. It gives the flexibility to be used in different dashboard modes (Overview, Music player, Calendar, Photo frame, Thermostat, Clock, Weather)

Homie connects directly to Home Assistant over a Long-Lived Access Token and a local WebSocket connection which results in automatic caching.

## Get Started with HACS Integation

⚠️ Save/Backup your config.js file in Step 6 after you make your changes! Every time you download a new release, the config file will be overwritten and you will lose your changes. ⚠️

### Step 1: Add the Custom Repository in HACS
1. In your Home Assistant sidebar, click on HACS.
2. Click the three dots (menu icon) in the top-right corner and select Custom repositories.
3. In the window that pops up, fill out the following fields:
   - Repository: https://github.com/Big-Edge2297/homie-dashboard
   - Type: Select Dashboard.
4. Click Add.
5. Once added, find Homie Dashboard in your HACS list, click it, and click Download.

Result: This creates the folder structure on your system: config/www/community/homie-dashboard/. You can browse to this location later so you can edit the config.js file.

### Step 2: Register the Lovelace Resource
Home Assistant needs permission to access the JavaScript files inside your local folders.
1. Go to Settings -> Dashboards.
2. Click the three dots in the top-right corner and select Resources.
   (Note: If you don't see "Resources", go to your Profile page by clicking your username in the bottom-left corner, turn on Advanced Mode, and return to this step).
3. Click Add Resource (bottom right).
4. Enter the details exactly like this:
   - URL: /local/community/homie-dashboard/homie-dashboard.js
   - Resource Type: JavaScript Module
5. Click Create.

### Step 3: Refresh Your Frontend Cache
To ensure Home Assistant registers the newly added resource files, clear your browser cache:
   - Windows: Press Ctrl + F5
   - Mac:
     1. Enable Developer menu in Safari (Safari → Settings → Advanced → Show features for web developers)
     2. In the new "Develop" menu, select "Empty caches".

### Step 4: Create a Dashboard in the Sidebar
1. Go to Settings -> Dashboards.
2. Click Add Dashboard in the bottom-right corner.
3. Choose Webpage from the list.
4. Fill out the URL box and click next
   - URL: /local/community/homie-dashboard/homie-dashboard.html
5. Fill out the configuration box and click create
   - Title: Homie Dash
   - Icon: Choose an icon (e.g., mdi:tablet-dashboard)
  
Result: You will now see a Homie Dashboard tab in your left sidebar. Clicking it will load your user interface. It will show Connection Lost - Retrying at the top and entities will be empty. Your dashboard is now visible, but it needs permission to talk to your Home Assistant data.

### Step 5: Configure Your config.js File
5A. Generate an Access Token
1. Click your username in the bottom-left sidebar to open your Profile
2. Go to Security at the top of the page
3. Scroll to the bottom of the Profile page to Long-Lived Access Tokens
4. Click Create Token
5. Give it a name (e.g. Homie Dashboard) and click OK
6. Copy the token immediately — HA will never show it again
7. Keep it somewhere safe temporarily while you complete the setup

5B. Set Up the Configuration File
Navigate to your Home Assistant folder: config/www/community/homie-dashboard/
1. Look for a file named config.js.
2. Edit the config.js file (create a backup file before each change in case you mess up something).
3. Paste your Long-Lived Access Token into the token field and update the server URL configuration to match your Home Assistant IP address.
4. Follow the config.js file documentation to make changes to the entity names and save the file
5. DELETE THE FILE config.js.gz. This is something that HACS serves and it's causing issues, investigating solutions. 
6. Refresh your Homie Dashboard sidebar page, and it will connect directly to your Home Assistant entities!

⚠️ Save/Backup your config.js file! Every time you download a new release, the config file will be overwritten and you will lose your changes. ⚠️  

Remember to clear the cache/hard refresh so the new file changes apply in the browser. On a tablet you will need to clear the Home Assistant companion app cache, in the app storage settings. Do not clear storage, only cache.

---

## Security

⚠️ The HA Long-Lived Access Token is stored in plain text inside the config.js file. Anyone who can read the file has full access to your Home Assistant instance.

> DON'T BE like the guy in Massachusetts that has a room named Jason's room - if you have been on Reddit long enough, you will get the joke :)

**Recommendations:**
- Serve the file only on your local network — never expose it to the internet without authentication
- Create a dedicated HA user account for the dashboard token rather than using your personal admin account so you can limit access and exposure
- Revoke and regenerate the token periodically (HA → Profile → Long-Lived Access Tokens)
- For remote access, use a VPN (e.g. WireGuard)
