- Haptic Feedback on suported Android devices

  On Android devices that support the Vibration API, every interaction produces a vibration matched to the action:

  | Intensity | Pattern | When It Fires |
  |---|---|---|
  | `light` | 18 ms | Open/close popups, accordion expand, media controls |
  | `medium` | 35 ms | Toggle lights, switches, chips on/off; select AC mode |
  | `heavy` | 30–60–50 ms (double-tap) | AC power, purifier power, fire a scene |

  Silently does nothing on unsupported devices

- Control Popups

  Tapping a chip opens a modal popup with detailed controls. The card type is determined automatically by the entity domain:
  | Entity Domain | Card Type & Controls |
  |---|---|
  | `light.*` | Brightness slider + colour presets + colour-temperature (Warm / Neutral / Cool) |
  | `climate.*` | AC card — power toggle, mode (cool/heat/fan/dry), fan speed, temperature nudge |
  | `cover.*` | Blind/curtain card — open, stop, close + position slider. Support for side-pull curtains |
  | `fan.*` | Air purifier card — power toggle + fan-speed percentage slider |
  | `switch.*` / `input_boolean.*` | Simple on/off toggle |
  | `group.*` | Simple toggle (no card controls) |
